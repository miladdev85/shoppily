### Purpose:
Become proficient with CSS and SCSS.

### Platform:
Using Strapi as Headless CMS for all products. Configured Strapi with MongoDB.
Front-end is deployed on Netlify.
Back-end / Headless CMS (Strapi) is hosted on Heroku. 

It's a free plan on Heroku, so the first load can be slow due to the server sleeping and not responding to API calls.

Overkill, yes. But it was cool setting up Strapi and use it as Headless CMS and only use API calls for getting the products. This shows that I can read documentation and troubleshoot ;)

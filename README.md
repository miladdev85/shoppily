Purpose:
Get familiar with SCSS and use no CSS Framework

Result:
I'm comfortable with CSS now. 

Platform:
Using Strapi as Headless CMS for all products. Configured Strapi myself with MongoDB.
Hosted on Heroku. It's on Heroku free plan so the first load can be slow due to the server sleeping.
Overkill, yes. But it was cool setting up Strapi and use it as Headless CMS and only use API calls for getting the products. This shows that I can read documentation and troubleshoot ;)

### Platform:

Using Strapi as Headless CMS for all products. Configured Strapi with MongoDB.
Front-end is deployed on Netlify.
Back-end / Headless CMS (Strapi) is hosted on Heroku.

It's a free plan on Heroku, so the first load can be slow due to the server sleeping and not responding to API calls.
